abstract: The water cycle plays an essential role in arc volcanism, earthquake
  generation, mantle rheology, and thermal structure of subduction zones.
  Previous seismic studies have revealed strong structural heterogeneities in
  the megathrust zone in Northeast Japan and Hokkaido. However, water
  transportation in the forearc region remains poorly understood due to the lack
  of long-term seismic observatories at the seafloor. Using high-quality data
  recently recorded by the permanent ocean-bottom-seismometer network (S-net) in
  the Pacific Ocean off Northern Japan, we study the fine three-dimensional P
  wave velocity (Vp) structure of the crust and upper mantle beneath the Kuril
  and Tohoku forearc region. Our results reveal high velocities in the
  mantle-wedge corner, implying a low degree of serpentinization there. We
  suggest that the forearc mantle in the study region is cold and anhydrous. The
  slab interface under the forearc area may have a low permeability, which
  controls the fluid flux to the mantle wedge and the overriding plate. A low-Vp
  layer atop the subducting Pacific plate is interpreted as the subducted
  oceanic crust. Dehydration of the subducted oceanic crust occurs at depths of
  80–120 km, providing a large volume of water to the overriding mantle wedge to
  produce arc volcanoes, and part of the water may migrate upward to the shallow
  area. Large megathrust earthquakes (Mw ≥ 6.0) mainly occurred around low-Vp
  patches in the megathrust zone. Destruction of the low-permeability slab
  interface would result in fluid flow upward, which may trigger large
  megathrust earthquakes and seismicity in the mantle wedge under the forearc.
