abstract: Oceanic transform faults, a key element of plate tectonics, represent
  the first-order discontinuities along mid-ocean ridges, host large
  earthquakes, and induce extreme thermal gradients in lithosphere. However, the
  thermal structure along transform faults and its effects on earthquake
  generation are poorly understood. Here we report the presence of a 10- to
  15-kilometer-thick in-depth band of microseismicity in 10 to 34 kilometer
  depth range associated with a high-temperature (700° to 900°C) mantle below
  the brittle lithosphere along the Romanche mega transform fault in the
  equatorial Atlantic Ocean. The occurrence of the shallow 2016 moment magnitude
  7.1 supershear rupture earthquake and these deep microearthquakes indicate
  that although large earthquakes occur in the upper brittle lithosphere, a
  substantial amount of deformation is accommodated in the semibrittle mylonitic
  mantle that resides at depths below the 600°C isotherm. We also observe a
  rapid westward deepening of this band of seismicity indicating a strong
  lateral heterogeneity.
